# Noraebook

Noraebook is an exmple of the first webapp I made using Django. 
It is used to look up and add songs to the database. The app does
not always follow DRY principles as you can see in the source code,
but I think it was a decent effort for a first app. It's currently
being showcased at <http://noraebook.benjaminkmiller.com>. Hopefully I can find
time to update the app with the skills I've learned since.
